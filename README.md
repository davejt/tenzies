# Getting Started with Tenzies game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was completed following the Scrimba tutorial "Learn React for Free": https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact

This is the Tenzies game developed during the course, plus an addition of displaying the number of rolls.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
